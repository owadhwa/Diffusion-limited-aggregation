# Diffusion-limited-aggregation

This is a simulation of diffusion limited aggregation. 

*Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA)* is a growth proccess of clusters of aggregated particles driven by their random diffusion. There are two types of particles, but only one of them can move freely. The movable particles diffuse in a 2-D space by random walk, while the immovable particles do nothing; they remain where they are. If a movable particle "collides" with an immovable particle (i.e., if they come close enough to each other, the movable particle becomes immovable and stays there forever. This is the only rule for the agents' interaction.  

The results of the simulation are as follows:
